# ProstheticFingerDesigner
Designer for prosthetic

INTRODUCTION
Today, the demand for prosthetic products in Russia has grown significantly compared to previous years and continues to grow steadily. Given the current situation, the production of prosthetics is now in high demand, which creates an increased burden on domestic prosthetic enterprises to constantly produce new products.
In order to cope with the production load and maintain competitiveness, enterprises need to increase production without loss of quality, and automation of design processes is becoming a key solution to this task. Modern computer-aided design (CAD) systems accelerate product development by quickly creating 2D and 3D models, automating routine operations, and instantly making changes, which reduces the time required to bring products to market. In addition, automation minimizes human errors, reducing the number of defects and improvements. This not only improves accuracy, but also reduces costs by reducing manual labor and virtual testing, eliminating expensive testing. Automation also provides flexibility in production â€” for example, scripts and plug-ins can be used to massively design similar structures. 

In this project, the software module "Prosthetic Finger Designer" is being developed, which is designed to create various versions of prosthetic fingers (picture below), and subsequent integration into nanoCAD CAD. The tool will help you create products individually according to the physiological parameters of a person, preparing digital models.

ORGANIZATION AND STRUCTURE
The software module contains 3 commands for constructing individual individual parts of the prosthesis: the command for constructing the ring of the prosthesis, the command for constructing the platform of the prosthesis, and the command for constructing the entire model of the prosthesis.
